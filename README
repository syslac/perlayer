Perlayer:

Audio player in Perl written as exercise after reading "Higher order perl".
This branch uses Mplayer as backend. Should probably be master branch too.

Dependencies:
 * Mplayer
 * DBI
 * Class::DBI::Sweet
 * MP3::Info
 * Ogg::Vorbis::Header
 * Term::ReadKey 

You can get all these requirements on a Debian-based system with 
 apt-get install mplayer libdbi-perl libmp3-info-perl libogg-vorbis-header-perl libclass-dbi-sweet-perl libterm-readkey-perl

Play modes:
 Default: shuffle tracks.
 Album: shuffle albums; plays whole album in order.
 Mood: Plays only albums you've tagged with the appropriate "mood" tag.

Options:
 To launch the player simply run
  perl ogg.pl (or ./ogg.pl)
 
 To add music to your collection, use
  perl ogg.pl -a /path/to/music

 You can run the player directly in "album mode":
  perl ogg.pl -p a

 You can run the player in "mood mode":
  perl ogg.pl -m happy
 

Commands:
 The player accepts one-letter commands from standard input (won't be echoed and no return is needed). Accepted commands are:
 
 * n : next song (skip)
 * p : pause player
 * q : quit
 * , : Lower volume
 * . : Increase volume
 * + : Like song
 * - : Dislike song
 * a : Activate album mode (listen to the whole album; shuffle albums)
 * t : Return to default mode (shuffle single songs)
 * c : Enter mood tag for the album (only works in album mode)
 * N : In album mode, skip whole album
