Perlayer:

Audio player in Perl written as exercise after reading "Higher order perl".
This branch uses Mplayer as backend. Should probably be master branch too.

Dependencies:
 * Mplayer
 * DBI
 * Class::DBI::Sweet
 * MP3::Info
 * Ogg::Vorbis::Header
 * Term::ReadKey 

You can get all these requirements on a Debian-based system with 
 apt-get install mplayer libdbi-perl libmp3-info-perl libogg-vorbis-header-perl libclass-dbi-sweet-perl libterm-readkey-perl


Options:
 To launch the player simply run
  perl ogg.pl (or ./ogg.pl, or perl ogg.pl -p)
 
 To add music to your collection, use
  perl ogg.pl -a /path/to/music
 

Commands:
 The player accepts one-letter commands from standard input. Accepted commands are:
 
 * n : next song (skip)
 * p : pause player
 * q : quit
 * , : Lower volume
 * . : Increase volume
 * + : Like song
 * - : Dislike song
 * a : Activate album mode (listen to the whole album; shuffle albums)
